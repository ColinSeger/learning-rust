<h1>Learning rust project</h1>
<p>Hello this is a hobby project where I am trying to learn how to code in rust</p>
<ul>
  So what are some things I will try to do?
  <li>
    Create a application that can display 2D drawings
  </li>
  <li>
    Figure out the windowing tool I chose to use (Winit)
  </li>
  <li>
    TODO Make list of goals (Perhaps minecraft clone in the long run?)
  </li>
</ul>
